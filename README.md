#### Description:
A webapp running on skynet that is capable of loading data via skylink and visualizing the data in an graph and also in a two dimensional table. The raw data can come from anywhere (e.g. Excel, VSCode or any other tools capable of saving textfiles). 

The viewer is designed for measurement data like temperatures, voltage/current curves and other physical signals. Every data channel has to be in a separate column delemited by a tabstop. The header should be one row (typically the channel name).
